# protonvpn-mon-gse
A Gnome Shell Extension to monitor the ProtonVPN connection established by the command line tool.  Forked from the excellent https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2569/gnordvpn-local/

1. Create a folder for the extension with `mkdir ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/gnordvpn-local@isopolito`
2. Copy the files from this repo into that folder
3. Enable the extension using `Tweaks` (if you don't have it, install via `sudo apt install gnome-tweaks`)
